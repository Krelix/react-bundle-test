## Playing with Buttons

This project is mainly an example on how to setup and work with React, React Router and Redux. It uses NodeJS (>= 5.5.0) to build and answer to server requests, and Webpack to build and bundle the app to be delivered to the user's browser.

### How to start

After checkout, just run `npm install` to install the NodeJS Modules. Then, just run `npm start` to start the application. Webpack will bundle the code and you can then access the site at http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/ (`/webpack-dev-server` enable hot swapping)
